### What is Deep Learning(DL)?

>> __*Concept*__: *{{ topic_16|safe }}*
>>
> Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows machines to learn from vast amounts of data.
> It leverages neural networks with multiple layers to identify patterns and make predictions automatically.
> It is particularly effective for tasks such as image recognition, language translation, and speech processing.
> Deep learning models derive insights directly from data, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.
> Common applications of Deep Learning include autonomous vehicles, chatbots, medical image analysis, and recommendation systems.
