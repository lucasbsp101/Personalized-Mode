### What is Deep Learning?

>> *{{ topic_16|safe }}*
>>
>
> Deep Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables machines to learn from large amounts of data.
> It uses neural networks with many layers to automatically find patterns and make predictions.
> It is very useful for tasks like image recognition, language translation, and speech processing.
> Deep learning models learn directly from data, without the need for manual feature extraction.
> Popular applications of Deep Learning include self-driving cars, chatbots, medical image analysis, and recommendation systems.
