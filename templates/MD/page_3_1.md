<h3>The practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) today are vast and span various fields. Here are some of the main ones:</h3>


<li>Virtual Assistants: Assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI to understand and respond to voice commands, perform tasks, and provide information.</li>
<li>Image and Video Recognition: Facial recognition tools, medical image analysis, and surveillance systems use AI to identify and classify objects and people.</li>
<li>Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars, such as those developed by Tesla and Waymo, use AI to navigate and make real-time decisions.</li>
