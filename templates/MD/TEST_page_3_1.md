### What is Python and why is it important for Artificial Intelligence?

---

First, let's discover what Python is and why it is so important for artificial intelligence.
Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented, and dynamically-typed programming language.
It is one of the most popular languages for artificial intelligence (AI) development due to its simplicity and ease of use.
Python provides a clear and readable syntax,
thus offering a smooth path to learn and build intelligent models without complex code structures.
