>> + Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
>> + Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
>> + Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
>> + In addition, these categories, there are also Semi-Supervised Learning and Self-Supervised Learning.
>> + Semi-Supervised Learning uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data, making it helpful when labeling data is costly or time-consuming.
>> + Self-Supervised Learning creates its own labels from raw data, allowing it to learn patterns without needing labeled examples.

>+ During the 'Interpretation' phase, the algorithm operates without any pre-existing labels or categories assigned to the data. Its task is to discern the data's organization or grouping by identifying intrinsic patterns.
> 
>+ The algorithm functions as the central component of the unsupervised learning procedure, employing methods such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection to discover patterns and structures within the data.
> 
>+ The processing phase illustrates the algorithm's application to the data.
>
>+ The resulting output demonstrates the conclusions drawn from the unsupervised learning process. In this specific scenario, the algorithm may have categorized the animals into distinct groups based on their species (elephants, camels, cows).

> + __Agent__: The decision-maker that performs actions.
> + __Environment__: The world or system in which the agent operates.
> + __State__: The situation or condition the agent is currently in.
> + __Action__: The possible moves or decisions the agent can make.
> + __Reward__: The feedback or result from the environment based on the agentâ€™s action.

> ### Features and resume of *Machine Learning*
>
> Machine Learning is a discipline that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
> It shares similarities with data mining, as both involve analyzing large datasets.
> For large companies, branding is essential, and reaching a relevant customer base becomes more straightforward.
> With a dataset, ML can identify various patterns within the data.
> Systems can learn from historical data and enhance their performance automatically.
> Machine learning is driven by data. Organizations generate vast amounts of data daily, allowing them to uncover significant relationships and make better decisions.
