1-PYTHON AND AI

**Python**provides a clear and readable syntax hence provides a smooth path to learn and build intelligent models without complex code structures.

- **Rich Ecosystem**: Offers extensive libraries and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) tailored for AI and machine learning.
- **Strong Community Support**: A large, active community of AI enthusiasts, researchers, and developers sharing knowledge and resources.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Ensures accessibility to help, tutorials, and insights for continuous learning.

**Artificial Intelligence**requires strong foundation in python and to ensure you have strong solid starting point,
we encourage you to refer to the[**Python tutorial**],
which serves as an invaluable resource for both beginners and seasoned developers.
