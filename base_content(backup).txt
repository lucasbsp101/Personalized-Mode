1-PYTHON AND AI OK
What is Python and why is it important for Artificial Intelligence?
1.1-First, let's discover what Python is and why it is so important for artificial intelligence.
Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented, and dynamically-typed programming language.
It is one of the most popular languages for artificial intelligence (AI) development due to its simplicity and ease of use.
Python provides a clear and readable syntax,
thus offering a smooth path to learn and build intelligent models without complex code structures.

tailored for AI and machine learning. Additionally, it has strong community support,
consisting of a large and active community of AI enthusiasts, researchers,
and developers who share knowledge and resources. The collaborative environment ensures accessibility to help,
tutorials, and insights for continuous learning.

2- AI OK
Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables computer systems to perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving,
decision-making, and image generation. Its goal is to replicate human-like cognitive functions,
allowing machines to handle complex tasks and adapt to changing conditions.
AI subsets include machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL),
natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and generative AI.

To develop these complex models, we leverage python frameworks like:
- TensorFlow is developed by Google Brain teams, it provides a comprehensive set of tools to build and train the neural networks.
- PyTorch is a framework that is developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR),
it facilitates easy debugging and more intuitive model-building process compared to static graphs.
- Scikit-Learn is a user-friendly machine learning library that focuses in supervised and unsupervised learning.

These frameworks offer versatility and scalability to empower developers and researchers to create intelligent solutions across a wide spectrum of applications.

3- MACHINE LEARNING OK
Machine learning allows developers to focus on the development of algorithm and models that enable
computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

There are three types of machine learning techniques:
1. Supervised Learning

In supervised learning**, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with its corresponding output.

Regression Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)*

Classification Algorithm

- Logistic Regression
- Decision trees
- Ensemble Classifiers
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is provided unlabeled data and is tasked with finding patterns or relationships within it.
The goal of the algorithm is to inherent structures or groups in the data.

Clustering Algorithms

- K-means
- Hierarchical Clustering**]
- DBSCAN

Dimensionality Reduction

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
The goal of the algorithm is to discover optimal strategies or actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

The application includes game playing, robotics, autonomous systems. The popular reinforcement learning algorithms are:

- Q-learning
- Model Based Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Q Network (DQN)
- REINFORCE
- Actor Critic
- Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation
- SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
ML has limitations like reliance on handcrafted features, struggles with high-dimensional unstructured data,
and limited capacity to model complex relationships, leading to the rise of deep learning
