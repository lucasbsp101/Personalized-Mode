Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
The goal of the algorithm is to discover optimal strategies or actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

The application includes game playing, robotics, autonomous systems. The popular reinforcement learning algorithms are:

- Q-learning
- Model Based Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Q Network (DQN)
- REINFORCE
- Actor Critic
- Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation
- SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)
ML has limitations like reliance on handcrafted features, struggles with high-dimensional unstructured data,
and limited capacity to model complex relationships, leading to the rise of deep learning
