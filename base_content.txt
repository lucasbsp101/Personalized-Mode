1-PYTHON AND AI
**Python**provides a clear and readable syntax hence provides a smooth path to learn and build intelligent models without complex code structures.

- **Rich Ecosystem**: Offers extensive libraries and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) tailored for AI and machine learning.
- **Strong Community Support**: A large, active community of AI enthusiasts, researchers, and developers sharing knowledge and resources.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Ensures accessibility to help, tutorials, and insights for continuous learning.

**Artificial Intelligence**requires strong foundation in python and to ensure you have strong solid starting point,
we encourage you to refer to the[**Python tutorial**]
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/),
which serves as an invaluable resource for both beginners and seasoned developers.

2- AI
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** enables computer systems to perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving,
decision-making, and image generation. Its goal is to replicate human-like cognitive functions,
allowing machines to handle complex tasks and adapt to changing conditions.
AI subsets include machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL),
natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and generative AI.

To develop these complex models, we leverage python frameworks like:

- **TensorFlow** is developed by Google Brain teams, it provides a comprehensive set of tools to build and train the neural networks.
- **PyTorch** is a framework that is developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR),
it facilitates easy debugging and more intuitive model-building process compared to static graphs.
- **Scikit-Learn** is a user-friendly machine learning library that focuses in supervised and unsupervised learning.

These frameworks offer versatility and scalability to empower developers and researchers to create intelligent solutions across a wide spectrum of applications.

3- MACHINE LEARNING
**Machine learning**allows developers to focus on the development of algorithm and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

There are three types of machine learning techniques:
### 1. Supervised Learning

In**supervised learning**, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with its corresponding output.

###Regression Algorithms

- [**Linear Regression**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-regression/)
- [**Polynomial Regression**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-implementation-of-polynomial-regression/)
- [**Support Vector Regression (SVR)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-regression-svr-using-linear-and-non-linear-kernels-in-scikit-learn/)

###Classification Algorithm

- [**Logistic Regression**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-logistic-regression/)
- [**Decision trees**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decision-tree/)
- [**Ensemble Classifiers**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ensemble-classifier-data-mining/)
- [**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/support-vector-machine-algorithm/)
- [**k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-nearest-neighbours/)
- [**Naive Bayes**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-bayes-classifiers/)

### Unsupervised Learning

In[**unsupervised learning**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unsupervised-learning/), the algorithm is provided unlabeled data and is tasked with finding patterns or relationships within it. The goal of the algorithm is to inherent structures or groups in the data.

### Clustering Algorithms

- [**K-means**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-means-clustering-introduction/)
- [**Hierarchical Clustering**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-hierarchical-clustering-agglomerative-and-divisive-clustering/)
- [**DBSCAN**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbscan-clustering-in-ml-density-based-clustering/)

### Dimensionality Reduction

- [**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/principal-component-analysis-pca/)
- [**t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-t-distributed-stochastic-neighbor-embedding-t-sne-algorithm/)
- [**Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-discriminant-analysis/)

### Reinforcement Learning

In[**reinforcement learning**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-reinforcement-learning/), the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal of the algorithm is to discover optimal strategies or actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

The application includes game playing, robotics, autonomous systems. The popular reinforcement learning algorithms are:

- [**Q-learning**]
- [**Model Based Reinforcement Learning**]
- [**Deep Q Network (DQN)**]
- [**REINFORCE**]
- [**Actor Critic**]
- [**Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation**]
- [**SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)**]
ML has limitations like reliance on handcrafted features, struggles with high-dimensional unstructured data,
and limited capacity to model complex relationships, leading to the rise of deep learning

4- DEEP LEARNING
[**Deep learning**]derives inspiration from structure of human brain. The human brain consists of billions of neurons that communicate through electrochemical signals and in DL, artificial neural networks are composed of nodes that are interconnected with weights.

###Fundamentals of Deep Learning

To understand basic neural network, we need to build a solid groundwork for mastering deep learning using the following fundamentals:

- [**Gradient Descent Algorithm**]
- [**Backpropagation**]
- Hyperparameters
    - [**Activation Functions**]
    - [**Epochs**]
    - [**Optimizers**]
    - [**Batch Size**]
    - [**Learning rate**]
- [**Loss Functions**]

###Deep Learning Architecture

Deep learning architectures are structured neural network models designed to facilitate complex learning
tasks by automatically identifying patterns and representations within data. Below are foundational structures in deep learning:

- [**Perceptron**]
- [**Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**]
- [**Multi-Layer Perceptron**]
- [**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**]
- [**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**]
