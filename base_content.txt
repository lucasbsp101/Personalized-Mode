Artificial Intelligence (AI) signifies an evolving domain of scientific exploration, merging varied fields within Data Science. These areas range from task-specific AI applications to comprehensive AI systems that mimic human cognitive processes. AI's scope includes methodologies like machine learning, where systems derive knowledge from data; deep learning, which advances machine learning via complex neural networks; and the analysis of large datasets, known as big data, to extract insightful patterns through data mining.

Example:
You know when you're on YouTube, TikTok, or Netflix, and you see that list of videos or shows that you're 'definitely going to love'? That's AI in action! These systems use machine learning to analyze what you've already watched, liked, or searched for, and then they 'guess' what you'll want to see next. It's like having a friend who knows you really well and always recommends the best stuff. This same technology is used in online stores, like Amazon, to show you products you might want to buy.

Example:
Ever wondered how your phone recognizes faces in photos? That's AI! And guess what? You can do something similar with Python. Using libraries like TensorFlow or OpenCV, you can build programs that 'see' and understand images. Imagine creating a program that tells you if there's a cat or dog in a picture, or even a program that recognizes different types of flowers. It's like giving your computer superpowers to see! And you can totally do this with Python.

Machine learning enables computers to automatically recognize patterns and make decisions using data and algorithms.
It is broadly classified into three types:

Data serves as the bedrock of machine learning, forming the basis for training and testing models. Data comprises inputs (features) and outputs (labels). During training, a model learns patterns and is evaluated on unseen data to assess its performance and generalization.
The process of making predictions involves several essential steps that data undergoes to produce a predictive machine learning model. The predictions are:

As previously discussed, supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where each input is paired with the correct output. The model 1  learns by comparing its predictions with the actual answers in the training data, adjusting itself to minimize errors and improve accuracy. The objective of supervised learning is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. For example, a model trained to recognize handwritten digits uses its learned knowledge to identify new numbers. Supervised learning encompasses supervised learning classification and supervised learning regression, making it a pivotal technique in AI and supervised data mining. A core concept is learning a class from examples, where the model is provided with labeled examples to learn distinguishing features, such as classifying images of cats and dogs.

Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns and relationships in unlabeled data, without prior knowledge of the data’s meaning.
Unsupervised algorithms discover hidden patterns without human intervention, relying solely on input parameters to identify groups or patterns.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on agents learning to make decisions through trial and error to maximize cumulative rewards.
RL allows machines to learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback based on their actions, in the form of rewards or penalties.

Neural Networks, inspired by the human brain, are foundational to deep learning.
They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” that perform specific calculations, processing input data through mathematical functions and passing the output to subsequent layers. Below you see some subtopics:

Predicting Apartment Prices
Goal: Build a simple Neural Network to predict apartment prices based on their size.
How it works (simplified):
Data: We have a dataset with the size (in square meters) and selling price of various apartments.
Simple Neural Network: We'll create a very basic neural network with just one layer:
Input: The apartment size (in square meters).
Neuron: A neuron that receives the size as input, multiplies it by a weight, and adds a bias.
Output: The estimated apartment price.
Training: We adjust the weight and bias so that the network's output (the estimated price) is as close as possible to the actual selling prices of the apartments in our dataset.
Prediction: Once trained, the neural network can receive the size of a new apartment and provide a price estimate.
Practical Example:
Imagine we have the following data:
50m² apartment: $200,000
70m² apartment: $280,000
100m² apartment: $400,000
The neural network will learn the relationship between size and price by adjusting the weight and bias.
When we give the neural network the size of a new apartment (e.g., 80m²), it can provide a price estimate.
Why this example is useful:
It demonstrates the basic concept of how a neural network learns from data and makes predictions.
It's a practical application of neural networks in a regression problem (predicting a numerical value).
It shows how neural networks can be used to model relationships between variables.
This simplified example helps to understand the essence of how neural networks work in a more direct and applicable context.

Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning:
Imagine you want to know how much a house is worth, based on its features. Machine Learning can help you with that! The idea is to use data from houses that have already been sold, with information like size, number of bedrooms, location, etc., to "teach" a model to predict the price of new houses.
How it works:
Data Collection: First, we gather a dataset with information about houses that have been sold, including their features and sale prices.
Model Training: We use a Machine Learning algorithm, such as linear regression, to analyze the data and find patterns. The model learns the relationship between house features and their prices.
Prediction: After being trained, the model can receive the features of a new house and predict its estimated price.
Evaluation: To know if the model is working well, we compare its predictions with the actual prices of houses that were not used in training. We use metrics like mean squared error to measure the model's accuracy.
Applications:
Real Estate Market: Brokers and buyers can use Machine Learning models to estimate property values and make more informed decisions.
Property Valuation: Banks and insurance companies can use models to assess the value of properties for mortgage or insurance purposes.
Real Estate Investment: Investors can use models to identify investment opportunities in areas with potential for appreciation.
In summary, Machine Learning can be a powerful tool for predicting house prices, helping to make more accurate and informed decisions in the real estate market.
